# Network-Log-and-Traffic-Analysis
Identify malicious behavior and attacks using Machine Learning with Python




## Purpose

We selected this dataset because it is a complex as well as a technical dataset that is used on live data retaining value depending on its freshness. We are interested in learning more about security, its attacks, and their patterns.

The amount of real-time processing that can be done by analyzing the data collected can reduce a lot of manual work and catch patterns in attacks that occur over a large period of time that a human cannot identify.

These logs also allow us to see the amount of data being transferred and allowing organizations to allocate bandwidth depending based on the future scope of usage patterns.
